# Virtual Salesman 3

The Virtual Salesman 3 is a new generation of selling software destined to small and medium
bussinesses and independant workers. It was designed to allow you to easily manage inventories and
invoices, so it does not allow you to do any accounting. This specialisation makes it is very fast,
versatile and simple to use.

It allows you to easily manage inventories, employees, clients and suppliers lists.
And it is possibile to create and manage more than one company with the same software.
It is the best alternative to writing your invoice by hand or using Spreadsheets like Excel
since it allows the automatisation of selling procedures and inventory management and,
with the web module, you can use your inventories online, allowing
you clients to directly have access to your most recent products and prices.
